#📄 Project Statement — Student Record Management System
##📝 Problem Statement
Educational institutions often need a simple, reliable, and efficient method to manage important student information such as Name, Course, CGPA, and State.
Traditional manual record-keeping can lead to errors, data inconsistency, difficulty in searching, and challenges during updates.

This project addresses these issues by building a Python-based Command Line Student Record Management System that allows users to add, retrieve, update, and delete student details quickly and accurately.
The system ensures smooth navigation through a menu-driven interface and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts widely useful in academic settings.

📌 Scope of the Project
✔ The project includes:
Developing a modular Python program that manages student records using dictionary-based storage.
Supporting complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for student data.
Providing a user-friendly CLI menu for smooth interaction.
Using in-memory storage, allowing quick data processing during execution.
Demonstrating essential programming concepts suitable for beginners, students, and academic assignments.
❌ The project does not include:
Database connectivity (MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.)
Permanent data storage in files (can be added as enhancement)
GUI (Graphical User Interface)
Multi-user / network-based accessibility
This clearly defines the boundaries and purpose of the system.

🎯 Target Users
This system is designed for:

👨‍🎓 Students
Learning Python logic building and data handling
Practicing dictionaries, user input, and control flow
Understanding CRUD operations in a real example
👩‍🏫 Teachers / Instructors
Useful as a teaching model for:

Functions & modular programming

⚙ High-Level Functional Features
Below are the core functionalities the system provides:

1. ➕ Add Student
Allows users to enter a new student record using a unique registration number.

2. 🔍 Search Student
Lets the user search for a student based on the registration number.

3. ✏ Update Student
Users can update existing student information.
If the user leaves any field blank, the original value is retained.

4. 🗑 Delete Student
Removes a student record permanently from the system.

5. 📋 Display All Students
Displays all stored student records in a clear, organized format.

6. 📂 Menu-Driven Interface
A simple and intuitive CLI interface that helps users navigate through all operations effortlessly.
